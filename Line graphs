A line graph has a line that connects all the points in a diagram
To create a line, use the plot( ) function and add the type parameter with a value “1”

Plot(1:10, type=“1”)

Line color
The line color is black by default, to change the color use the col parameter:

Plot(1:10, type = “1”, col = “blue”)

Line width
To change the width of the line, use the lwd parameter ( 1 is default while 0.5 means 50% smaller
and 2 means 100% larger)

Plot(1:10, type=“1”, lwd=2)

Line styles
The line is solid by default. Use the lty parameter with a value from 0 to 6 to specify the line
format

For example, lty=3 will display a dotted line instead of a solid line

Plot( 1:10, type=“1”, lwd=5, lty=3)

0 removes the line
1 displays a solid line
2 displays a dashed line
3 displays a dotted line
4 displays a “dot dashed” line
5 displays a “long dashed” line
6 displays a “two dashed” line

Multiple lines
To display more than one line in a graph, use the plot( ) function together with the lines ( ) function

Line1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
Line2 <- c(2,4,5,6,8,10)

Plot(line1, type = “1”, col = “blue”)
Lines(line2, type = “1”, col = “red”)

//OUTPUT

The calculator makes two different lines on the graph
