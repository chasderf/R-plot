In statistics, there are often three values that interest us

Mean - the average value
Median - the middle value
Mode - the most common value

Mean
To calculate the average value (mean) of a variable from the mtcars data set, find the sum of all
values, and divide the sum by the number of values

Mean ( ) function gets the mean value
WT is the average weight

//INPUT
Data_Cars <- mtcars
Mean( Data_Cars$wt)
//OUTPUT::
[1] 3.21

R median

The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values

If we take a look at the values of the wt variable (from the mtcars data set), we will see that there are
two numbers in the middle)

Note: if there are two numbers in the middle, you must divide the sum of those numbers by two, to
find the median

Luckily R has a function that does all of that for you, just use the median ( ) function to find the
middle value

//INPUT
Data_Cars <- mtcars
Median(Data_Cars$wt)
//OUPUT
3.21

Mode

The mode value is the value that appears the most number of times

R does not have a function to calculuat the mode, however we cna create our own function to find
it.

If we take a look at the values of the wt variable ( from the mtcars data set ) , we will see that the
numbers 3.44 are often shown

Instead of counting it ourselves, we can use the following code to find the mode

Data_Cars <- mtcars
Names(sort(-table(Data_Cars$wt))) [1]
