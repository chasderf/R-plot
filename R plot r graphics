Plot
The plot ( ) function is used to draw points (markers) in a diagram

Parameter 1 specifies points on the x - axis
Parameter 2 specifies points on the y - axis

At its simplest, you can use the plot ( ) function to plot two numbers against each other:

Plot (1, 3)

To draw more points, use vectors:

Draw two points in the diagram, one at position (1,3) and one in position (8,10) :

Multiple points

You can plot as many points as you like, just make sure you have the same number of
points in both axis:

Plot(c(1,2,34,5), c(3,6,7,10) )

X <- c( 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5)
Y <- c(3,7,8,9)

Plot (x,y)

Sequences of Points

If you want to draw dots in a sequence, on both the x - axis and the y - axis ;
use the : operator

Plot(1:10)

Draw a line
The plot( ) function also takes a type parameter with the value 1 to draw a line to
connect all the points in the diagram

Plot(1:10, type = “1”)

Plot labels

The plot ( ) function also accept other parameters such as main, xlab and y lab if you
want to custamasize the graph with main title and different labels for the x and y axis

Plot(1:10, main=“My Graph”, xlab = “The x-axis”, ylab = “The y-axis”)

Graph appearance
There are many other parameters you can use to change the appearance of the
points

Colors
Use col = “color” to add a color to the points

Plot(1:10, col=“red”)

//OUTPUT
It plots the colors in red

Size

Use cex=number to change the size of the points (1 is default, while 0.5 means
50% smaller, and 2 means 100% larger)

Plot(1:10, cex=2)
//OUPUT
It prints a larger bubble

Point shape
Use pch with a value from 0 to 25 to change the point shape format:

//INPUT
Plot(1:10, pch=25, cex=2)
