Data set

A data set is a colleciton of data, often presented in a table

There is popular built in data set in R called “mtcars” (Motor Trend Car Road Tests), which is
retrieved from the 1974 motor Trend US magazine

In the examples below ( and for the next chapters ), we will sue the mtcars data set, for statistical
purposes

Mtcars

Information about the data set

You can use the question mark ( ? ) to get information about the mtcars data set

?mtcars

Get information

Use the dim( ) function to find the dimensions of the data set, and the names ( ) function to view the
names of the variables :

Data_cars <- mtcars
Rownames (Data_Cars)

From the ex. Above we just gain lists and vectors from the back-end and cloud allocation

Print variable values
If you want to print all values that belong to a variable , access the data frame by using the $ sign,
and the name of the variable ( for example cyl cylinder)

Data_Cars <- mtcars
Data_Car$cyl
This practically

Sort variable values
To sort the values use the sort ( ) function

Data_Cars <- mtcars
Sort ( Data_Cars$cyl)

//OUPUT
This just lists how many cylinders occur

Analyze the data
Now that we have some information about the data set, we can start to analyze it with some
statistical numbers

For example, we can use the summary ( ) function to get a statiscal summary of the data

Data_Cars <- mtcars

Summary(Data_Cars)

Don’t worry if you do not understand the outpu Numbers. You will master them shortly

The summary( ) function returns 6 statistical numbers for each variable:

Min

First quantile (percentile)
Median
Mean
Third quantile ( percentile )
Max
