In the previous chapter, we introduce lists of cars with a data set

You learned from the R math chapter that R has several built in math functions. For example, the
min ( ) and max ( ) functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in a set

Data_Cars <- mtcars

Max(Data_Car$hp)
Min(Data_Cars#hp)

For example, we can use the which.max( ) and which.min( ) function to find the index position of the
max and min value in the table:

Or even better, combine which.max( ) and which.min( ) and the rownames ( ) functions to get the
name of the car wiht the largest and smallest horsepower

Data_Cars <- mtcars

Rownames(Data_Cars) [which.max(Data_Cars$hp) ]
Rownames(Data_Cars) [ which.min(Data_Cars$hp) ]
